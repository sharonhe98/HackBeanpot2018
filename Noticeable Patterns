- beginning of Json files (we don't want this within our quote parsing)
      -shown with "==" (double equals)
      -some sort of tag?

- dialogue is not in quotes, but ACTIONS are in SQUARE BRACKETS ("[" and "]")
      -everything in between is an action, not a quote
      -alternatively: ''[...]''
      -alternatively again: ''(...)'' <-- basically if you see TWO single quotes, ignore anything in between
      
- speakers are separated in a template from dialogue itself
      -speaker template is something like "colon three single quotes x three single quotes colon" (:'''Harry''':)
